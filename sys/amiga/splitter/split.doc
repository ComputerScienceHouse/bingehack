	Splitter			[split.doc 95/07/02]

Usage:
	splitter [-Cc_prototype] [-Dd_prototype] [-ddir_prototype] binary

Default prototypes:
	d: %n.dir
	C: %n.c%C
	D: %n.d%D

Prototypes:
	%n	base file name
	%C	current code file #
	%D	current data file #

Creates:
	binary.dir		directions file
	binary.d00		data files
	binary.d01 ...
	binary.c00		code files
	binary.c01 ...

Format of the directions file (subject to change):
	Cbinary.c00
	Cbinary.c01
	Cbinary.c02
	Dbinary.d00
	Dbinary.d01
The above entries may be edited to reflect the location of the various files
if it is necessary for them to be moved by the user.  All C entries must
precede all D entries.  Whitespace is permitted after the directive key
and before the filename.

Maximum output file size is 800K (819200 bytes) - this leaves just enough
space on an empty floppy for a small icon.  Note that splitter will now
break a hunk as needed to respect the file size limit.

Code file contents:
The first code file contains:
	the (modified) HUNK_HEADER from the original binary
	(followed by)
All code files contain:
	HUNK_CODE's from the original binary

Data file contents:
	HUNK_BSS's from the original binary
	HUNK_DATA's from the original binary

CHANGES FOR 3.1.1:
	Faster loading by buffering offsets.
	Smaller files: splitter will now write out HUNK_RELOC32short
	relocation blocks whenever possible.
	Blanks may now be between the C/D and the file name in the .dir file.

CHANGES FOR 3.2:
	Hunks will now be split if necessary.

BUGS
	The present system for generating multiple files is a hack -
	multi.[ch] should be upgraded instead.

	Many optimizations for minimizing the size of the output file
	could/should/will be added.
