Subject: ship.tar.uu - amiga shipping scripts

I fully admit that these are not things of beauty.  They've been
hacked and re-hacked since 3.0PL8 or so, but they do work.
The metareadme file is my crib sheet - the thing that's not in there
is the overall scheme:
	compile
	run filldir - this builds trees of disk images
	run dozoo - this builds that archives and automatically builds
		the manifests
The wierd thing is that the copy from NetHack: (etc) to the image tree
can have three results:
- a successful copy
- a warning that there is no source (but the target already exists) - 
  this is how you put in things like icons and readmes that don't have
  source.
- a CAUTION that the file is just plain missing
