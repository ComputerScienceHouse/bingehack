The files in this directory are what remains of some utilities and
documentation used in past versions of NetHack.  They are generally
workarounds for various bugs and limitations of MSDOS compilers.  Should
you be stuck with a compiler whose version is not supported by the current
NetHack release, perhaps these files can help you.  Otherwise, they make
interesting historical and somewhat humorous reading.
