Dyer, Timo Hakulinen, Yamamoto Keizo, Mike Threepoint, Mike Stephenson,
Stephen White, Ken Washikita and Janet Walz.  The present ports are based
on the previous work of Pierre Martineau, Stephen Spackman, Steve Creps,

Credit for the porting of NetHack to the Win32 Console Subsystem goes to 
the NT Porting Team started by Michael Allison.

This version of NetHack for Win32 is a tty port utilizing the WIN32 
Console I/O subsystem.

I.  Dispelling the Myths:

    Compiling NetHack is not as easy as it sounds, nor as hard as it looks,
    however it will behoove you to read this entire file through before
    beginning the task.

    We have provided a Makefile for building NetHack using the
    following compiler:

        Microsoft Visual C++ V4.x

    The Makefile was created for use with MS NMAKE which is provided with 
    the Microsoft compiler.

    The supplied Makefile may work with earlier versions of the Microsoft
    32-bit compiler, but that has not been tested. 

    You may find it useful to obtain copies of lex (flex) and yacc (bison,
    or byacc).  While not strictly necessary to compile nethack, they are 
    required should you desire to make any changes to the level and dungeon 
    compilers.

    To use the distributed NetHack icon, a version of uudecode is required.

II. To compile your copy of NetHack on a 32 bit Windows machine (NT or 95):

Setting Up

1.  It almost goes without saying that you should make sure that your tools
    are set up and running correctly.  That includes ensuring that all the
    necessary environment variables for the Microsoft compiler environment
    are set correctly.  ( For example, by executing vcvars32.bat, which
    is in the bin directory of your compilers directory tree. )

2.  Make sure all the NetHack files are in the appropriate directory
    structure.  You should have a main directory with subdirectories
    dat, doc, include, src, sys\share, sys\winnt, util and win\tty.
    Other subdirectories may also be included in your distribution, but
    they are not necessary for building the TTY version for the Win32 
    console subsystem.  You can delete them to save space.  Your distribution 
    may contain a directory win\win32.  This window port variant was a
    recent addition and was not ready for the 3.2.2 release.  You may 
    ignore it (or contribute to it).

    Required Directories for a Win32 Console NetHack:

                            top
                             |
        ------------------------------------------------- 
        |       |     |        |       |     |          | 
       util    dat   doc    include   src   sys        win
                                             |          |
                                          ------      ----- 
                                          |    |      |    
                                       share  winnt  tty  
 

    Check the file "Files" in your top level directory for an exact
    listing of what file is in which directory.  In order for the
    Makefiles to work, all the source files must be in the proper
    locations.

    If you downloaded or ftp'd the sources from a UNIX system, the lines
    will probably end in UNIX-style newlines, instead of the carriage
    return and line feed pairs used by Windows.  Some programs have trouble
    with them, so you may need to convert them. The compiler should not
    have any problems with them however.

3.  Go to the sys\winnt directory and run the nhsetup.bat batch file.
    The necessary Makefile movements will be accomplished for you. It
    will also verify that your directories are set up properly.  It
    will also attempt to uudecode the NetHack icon contained in the
    file sys/winnt/nhico.uu.  You must uudecode this file manually 
    if the batch file fails to do so.

4.  Now go to the include subdirectory to check a couple of the header
    files there.  Things *should* work as they are, but since you have
    probably set up your system in some sort of custom configuration
    it doesn't hurt to check out the following:

    First check config.h according to the comments to match your system and
    desired set of features.  Mostly you need to check the WIZARD option,
    make sure the HACKDIR is set properly.

    Also check COMPRESS.

    You may include all or as few of the special game features as you wish.

    Also check ntconf.h, which should not need much editing. It is there that
    you may choose to enable color text character support by leaving
    TERMCOLOR uncommented, or disable color support by commenting out 
    TERMCOLOR.

5.  If you want to change the high score list behavior, examine the top of
    topten.c, in the src directory.  You may want to change the definitions of
    PERSMAX, POINTSMIN, and ENTRYMAX.  I set POINTSMIN to 51 and ENTRYMAX to
    50 to keep the size of the score list down.

6.  Go to the src directory and edit the top of your Makefile.
    Change the setting of (GAMEDIR) to reflect the directory where
    you want NetHack to be installed.  

    ie.  GAMEDIR = \games\nethackn

    The directory you specify *MUST* exist for all remaining steps to be 
    successful. Be sure the directory you want the game installed 
    actually exists.  If it doesn't, create it now.

    If you elected not to use the high-quality BSD random number routines by
    commenting out RANDOM in ntconf.h, comment out (or set equal
    to nothing) the RANDOM macro in your Makefile.

    If you are recompiling after patching your sources, or if you got your
    files from somewhere other than the official distribution, "touch
    makedefs.c" to ensure that certain files (onames.h and pm.h) are remade,
    lest potentially troublesome timestamps fool "nmake".

Compiling

7.  Now that everything is set up, and with your current directory set
    to src, run "nmake install".

    If you get any errors along the way  then something has not been set 
    up correctly. The time it takes to compile depends on your particular 
    machine of course, but you should be able to go for lunch and return 
    to find everything finished.  The less memory, and slower your machine, 
    the longer the lunch you may take.
    
    In any case, it is likely that the command prompt window where you are 
    doing the compiling will be occupied for a quite a while.  If all 
    goes well, you will get an NetHack executable.

Running NetHack

8.  Make sure all of the support files -- Guidebook.txt, license, logfile,
    NetHack.cnf, NetHack.exe, nhdat, record, and recover.exe -- were copied 
    to the game directory.  If not, move them there yourself.  NetHack.cnf 
    is distributed as sys/winnt/winnt.cnf.

    Edit NetHack.cnf to reflect your particular setup and personal 
    preferences, by following the comments.  With this release, HACKDIR
    defaults to the same directory as that where the NetHack.exe executable
    resides.  You only need to set HACKDIR in NetHack.cnf if, for some 
    reason, you wish to override that.
  
9a. Running from the command prompt:

    If you add the directory containing the NetHack executable
    to your PATH, you can just type "nethack" or "nethack -umike"
    to start it up.  Alternatively, you can explicitly invoke it with 
    a command such as "c:\games\nethack\nethack" (specifying whatever 
    drive and directory your NetHack executable resides in) each time.


9b. Running from a Windows shortcut (win95 or NT4.x) or from the 
    Program Manager (NT3.x):

    If you will be running it by launching it from program manager
    or from a shortcut, just use the following information when 
    setting up the icon or shortcut.

         Description      :  NetHack 3.2.2 
         Command Line     :  C:\GAMES\NETHACK\NETHACK.EXE

   (changing the directory to the appropriate one of course)

10. Play NetHack.  If it works, you're done!

Notes:

1)  To install an update of NetHack after changing something, enter "nmake"
    from the src directory.  If you add, delete, or reorder monsters or
    objects, or you change the format of saved level files, delete any save
    and bones files.  (Trying to use such files sometimes produces amusing
    confusions on the game's part, but usually crashes.)

    If you made changes to any of the level compiler software, you may have
    to delete dgn_flex.c, dgn_yacc.c, lev_flex.c, and lev_yacc.c from the
    util directory to ensure that they are remade.

2)  The executable produced by this port is a 32-bit, flat-address space, 
    non-overlayed .exe file, which should run on any true Win32 environment.
