To compile nethack, you must create a include/config_local.h file

include/config_local.h: Local overrides for config.h and unixconfig.h directives.

You can also create a config.mk to store your make defaults.
config.mk: Local overrides for make variables.

Example files follow:

config.mk:
PREFIX = $(PWD)/install

config_local.h:
#ifndef CONFIG_LOCAL
#define CONFIG_LOCAL

#define HACKDIR "/my/home/dir/nh343"
#define WIZARD "myuser"
#define VAR_PLAYGROUND HACKDIR "/var"
#define DUMP_FN HACKDIR "%t.nh343.txt"

#endif

Compilation requires at least the following:

GNU flex
GNU bison
GNU coreutils
GNU make
ncurses (with wide character support)
