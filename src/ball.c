/*
 *  To make this work, we have to mess with the hero's mind.  The rules for
 *  ball&chain are:
 *
 *	1. If the hero can see them, fine.
 *	2. If the hero can't see either, it isn't seen.
 *	3. If either is felt it is seen.
 *	4. If either is felt and moved, it disappears.
 *
 *  If the hero can see, then when a move is done, the ball and chain are
 *  first picked up, the positions under them are corrected, then they
 *  are moved after the hero moves.  Not too bad.
 *
 *  If the hero is blind, then she can "feel" the ball and/or chain at any
 *  time.  However, when the hero moves, the felt ball and/or chain become
 *  unfelt and whatever was felt "under" the ball&chain appears.  Pretty
 *  nifty, but it requires that the ball&chain "remember" what was under
 *  them --- i.e. they pick-up glyphs when they are felt and drop them when
 *  moved (and felt).  When swallowed, the ball&chain are pulled completely
 *  off of the dungeon, but are still on the object chain.  They are placed
 *  under the hero when she is expelled.
