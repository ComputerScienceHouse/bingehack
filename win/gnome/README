This directory contains the code written for GnomeHack. The NetHack devteam is
in the process of making it part of the normal distribution.  

These files are based on the files from GnomeHack 1.0.5.

Note: The nethack build is not driven by autoconf, so that ability is missing
from this code, even though some of its pieces may still linger.
