-----------------------------------
discarding a tin without eating should not count towards food conduct

redisplay correct trap glyphs when hallucination ends
monsters under Conflict cannot attack other monsters that are already dead
monsters that steal gold from monsters should teleport
fix mummy wrappings worn by monsters to block invisibility
applying a weapon or wieldable tool would sometimes give spurious messages

applying a weapon or wieldable tool might not always end two-weapon combat
giants cannot "easily pick up" boulders on the Sokoban level
W command would let you wear an arbitrary item in your body armor slot if that

	you want to wear?" prompt when all unworn armor couldn't be worn

	things if you split a merged stack in quiver or secondary weapon slot
save/restore while mounted or stuck could cause a game crash or other errors
baby gray dragons should not be visible to infravision
dying from a failed saddle attempt should name the monster without using
	hallucination
spurious "Bummer, you've hit the ground" when hallucinating and dismounting

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
MSDOS: fix clearlocks() to look for the right file names, 
	and not LEVELS.* (MFLOPPY only)
MSDOS: remove djgpp stuff from the Microsoft C Makefile
NT: WIN32 specific code in tty_nh_poskey() was missing the
	necessary code to clear window flags so after hitting ESC 
	messages that should have displayed did not

Qt: modify makefile to allow use with BSD make and FreeBSD
X11: fix memory leaks is reading from dialogs
