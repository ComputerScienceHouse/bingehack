Part I	    General Mythos

"Gehennom" (Gehenna) is a contraction of "Gei-ben-hinnom" (the valley of
the son of Hinnom).  It is a name of a small, deep, and dark valley south-
east of ancient Jerusalem.  In the pre-Hebraic era, that valley was the
center for the worship of Moloch, who demanded that children be sacrificed
to him.  It was (and still is) considered a fearful, dreadful place, where
suffering souls of dead people roam and seek revenge.  Gehennom was consid-
ered the place where a hidden port to the Under World exists.  Through that
port, demons, devils, and other servants of evil gods emerge sometimes to
do havoc among the living.

"Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch'entrate" is italian for 'All hope abandon, ye
who enter here'.

"The throne vanishes in a puff of logic." analogy comes from Douglas Adams'
Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy:

    "But," says man, "the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it?  It could
not have evolved by chance.  It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your
own argument, you don't.  QED."
    "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in
a puff of logic.
